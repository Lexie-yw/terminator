<p>{% blocktrans %}Terminator is an online multilingual collaborative terminology management platform. Terminator can be used to create terminology for any field. Terminator itself is free software licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License version 3</a>.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}This platform can coordinate work on several glossaries with multiple concepts, each having a definition and multiple terms for every configured language. Links to external resources can be added to help in terminology creation, and discussion on every concept in every language enables collaboration.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}The entries in a glossary can be enriched by specifying relationships between concepts, and by specifying additional data for every definition, external resource and term, for example data sources, status information and also grammatical information and usage examples.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}All changes are tracked and can be easily viewed by all users. Among the changes tracked are the latest changes to terms, comments, concepts and so on.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "Contributor Roles" %}</h2>
<p>{% blocktrans %}Most functionality require you to log in. You can get involved by commenting, or by providing terms and definitions. Logged in users can contribute according to different roles.{% endblocktrans %}

<p>{% blocktrans %}Users are assigned different roles for each glossary, thereby enabling collaboration while ensuring data integrity. Lexicographers have permission to edit more fields. They have the responsibility to review all fields and provide additional information to enrich entries. But feel free to leave your suggestions in the comments!{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "Terminology of this Platform" %}</h2>
<p>{% blocktrans %}A glossary is a collection of related concepts in a subject field. Each concept can be expressed as one or more terms in each language. Whereas a term is usually short (one or more words only), a definition is a fuller explanation of the concept.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "Workflow" %}</h2>
<p>{% blocktrans %}Terms and definitions are collected for the source language first. When there is agreement, the lexicographer can indicate that the conceptâ€™s source language is finalized. This indicates that work on additional languages can start. Again terms and definitions are collected.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}Logged-in users can comment on any entry, even after it has been finalized. Comments and suggestions for terms and definitions are all entered and reviewed in the work area for the concept.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "Import and Export of Data" %}</h2>
<p>{% blocktrans %}One of the features is the ability to export the data to TBX (TermBase eXchange) format which is used for interchange of terminology among different systems such as translation tools. The export process is configurable to allow exporting of a subset of terms according a number of criteria.{% endblocktrans %}
{% if features.autoterm %}
{% blocktrans %}Terminator can generate TBX files to feed the Autoterm feature in the Virtaal translation tool.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
{% endif %}

<p>{% blocktrans %}For integrating previous terminology work, Terminator can import files in the TBX format.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
