<p>{% blocktrans %}Terminator is an online multilingual collaborative terminology management platform. Terminator can be used to create terminology for any field. Terminator itself is free software licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License version 3</a>.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}This platform can coordinate work on several glossaries with multiple concepts, each having a definition and multiple terms for every configured language. Links to external resources can be added to help in terminology creation, and discussion on every concept in every language enables collaboration.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}The entries in a glossary can be enriched by specifying relationships between concepts, and by specifying additional data for every definition, external resource and term, for example data sources, status information and also grammatical information and usage examples.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}All changes are tracked and can be easily viewed by all users on the home page. Among the changes tracked are the latest changes to terms, comments, concepts and so on.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}Users are assigned different roles for each glossary, thereby enabling collaboration while ensuring data integrity.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}One of the key features is the ability to export the data to TBX (TermBase eXchange) format which is used for interchange of terminology among different systems such as translation tools. The export process is configurable to allow exporting of a subset of terms according a number of criteria. Terminator is also capable of automatically generating TBX files to feed the Autoterm feature in the Virtaal translation tool.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}For integrating previous terminology work, Terminator can import files in the TBX format.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
